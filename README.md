# Molecular Structure Representation Algorithm

This repository contains an algorithm that uses molecular structures to represent information and computation.

## Description

The Molecular Structure Representation Algorithm (MSRA) is a novel approach to modeling and understanding molecular structures. It takes a molecular structure as input, such as proteins, DNA, or RNA, and returns a representation of the information and computation that can be carried out on that structure.

### Applications

The MSRA can be used in various fields, including:

- **Computational Biology**: Analyzing and modeling the behavior of biological systems.
- **Chemistry**: Assisting in the design of new molecules with specific properties.
- **Information Theory**: Investigating the information content and computational capabilities of molecular structures.

## Usage

### Importing the Module

First, import the `molecular_structure_representation` module:

```python
import molecular_structure_representation
```

### Creating a Molecular Structure

Create a molecular structure by calling the `create_structure()` function, providing a list of atoms and bonds:

```python
structure = molecular_structure_representation.create_structure(["H", "O", "H"], [("H", "O"), ("O", "H")])
```

### Working with the Structure

Once you have created a molecular structure, you can use various functions to manipulate and analyze it:

- `get_information()`: Extracts information from the molecular structure.
- `get_computation()`: Analyzes the computation that can be carried out on the molecular structure.
- `serialize()`: Converts the molecular structure to a string representation.
- `deserialize()`: Reconstructs a molecular structure from a string representation.

## Example

```python
import molecular_structure_representation

structure = molecular_structure_representation.create_structure(["H", "O", "H"], [("H", "O"), ("O", "H")])

print(structure.get_information())
```

Output:

```
The molecular structure contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, bonded in a water molecule configuration.
```
